### appendix: contributions

This section details the types of contributions expected for certain committee roles.

#### Contributions - definition

As qualitative guideline reference, a contributions refers to

* work primarily towards the ``sktime`` project mission
* within the ``sktime`` governance framework
* not paid for by the ``sktime`` project

Qualitative non-examples would be:

* work that primarily serves a different purpose, e.g., (self-)promotion
* work not coordinated with project representatives,
  e.g., collecting funding or donations without authorization
* work in a paid developer or mentee role

Special non-examples:

* community contributions only count if they involve a majority of community members
  not from one's research group or direct network (by company affiliation
  or academic family tree). Network promotion falls in the same category as
  self-promotion. This is not forbidden, but does not count as contribution.
* Code or community contributions related exclusively to concrete
  estimators (or objects) owned by oneself and closely linked to corporate or academic
  self-agenda do not count towards eligibility.
  This is not forbidden, but does not count as contribution.
* PR and repository changes pertaining to ``sktime`` governance do not
  count towards code contributions, but they may count as community contributions
  if subject to the ``sktime`` governance framework (e.g., voting and
  decision making mechanisms).

#### Contributions - scope

``sktime`` values contributions of any kind - not just code.
Contributions to operations and functioning of the community and the project
as a whole are considered of at least equal importance.

Below sections contain examples of what ``sktime`` counts as contributions,
either to code or community, and magnitude of contributions.

To ensure a good degree of objectivity, magnitude of contributions
is tied to a working hour equivalent number, which is intended to be a
plausible mirror of a contract worker's billing hours for the same task.

#### Contributions - arbitration

The arbitration committee will have the final say on criteria satisfaction if any
dispute were to arise, strictly bound by precedent in accordance with
legal best practices.

In arbitration, the high-level guidance principles and reference figures
should be applied. All other conditions being equal, decisions should
be made in favour of the contributor.

A record of all decisions and precendents by the arbitration committee
must be publicly kept to the maximal extent allowed by data protection regulations.

#### Small contributions

As a reference figure, a single small contribution is approximately a
cumulative 2 working hour equivalent.

We count as small contributions (code) any of:

* fixing typos in documentation or docstrings. At most 3 of these count in a given period,
  and at most 1 trivial typo fix counts.
* reviewing a PR that does not require a STEP, and not dropping the review (max 2 weeks latency)
* reproducing a bug reported by a user, and reporting on reproduction

We count as small contributions (community) any of:

* answering a user question in one of the help/contributor channels (e.g., discord helpdesk) until user confirmation of answer
* writing minutes in one of the ``sktime`` committee meetings
* as committee member, attending meetings of the respective committee and being minuted as present
* filling out and submitting the user registration form

#### Medium contributions

As a reference figure, a single medium contributions is approximately a
cumulative 10 working hour equivalent.

Examples for medium contributions (code) are:

* 5 small code contributions
* successfully fixing a bug in an estimator, framework or utility code.
  Acknowledging the substantial variance in bug complexity, 
* successfully diagnosing a bug reported by a user, or contributing substantially to identifying the cause.
  Reports already including correct (or almost correct) diagnoses count towards the reporters' tally.
* getting a code PR merged (bugfix, enhancement, etc)
* reviewing a STEP or a PR that implements a STEP

Examples for medium contributions (community) are:

* 5 small community contributions
* participating in 3 mentoring meetings as co-mentor, in one of the ``sktime`` mentoring or internship programmes.
  Full co-mentoring of a typical summer internship counts as 3 medium contributions.
* organizing a presentation or workshop, optimally involving and mentoring new contributors to present.
  Importantly, this should include the "background work" of preparation of materials (abstract submission, notebooks etc),
  and the presentation should have community promoting character (not self-promoting).
* donating the monetary equivalent of 10 hours median working wage of one's country of residence,
  or one's own wage, whichever lower, to an ``sktime`` charitable account.
  At most 3 such donations count towards contributions to prevent "buying influence" dynamics.

#### Substantial contributions

As a reference figure, substantial contributions are of a
cumulative 50 working hour equivalent or more.

Where substantial contributions are referenced, they are typically considered
within a time period - such time periods are part of the reference context.

Examples for substantial contributions (community) are:

* lead organizing a major community event, e.g., developer days
* running one of the ``sktime`` mentoring or internship programmes for one full period (e.g., summer)
* taking on mentorship for a junior community member for at least 9 meetings, in one of the ``sktime`` mentoring or internship programmes
* organizing a series of workstream or roadmap meetings that lead to successful STEP and PR
* acquiring funding in the order of 1 year of maintainer position, under strategic control of the ``sktime`` community.
  This should be fundraising rather than a direct donation.
* leading on a relevant workstream of administrative proceedings, e.g., drafting a contract, giving legal advice
* carrying out defined community roles with 1-2h weekly load for at least 6 months according to expectation and specification, e.g.:

  * community council member
  * treasurer
  * fundraising manager

Examples for substantial contributions (technical) are:

* carrying out defined technical roles with 1-2h weekly load for at least 6 months according to expectation and specification, e.g.:

  * release manager

We count as substantial contributions any of:

* more than 5 medium contributions in the period of any type. The overall contribution type(s) is/are determined by whichever type(s) reach(es) a count of 4 or more.
