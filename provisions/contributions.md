### appendix: contributions

This section details the types of contributions expected for certain committee roles.

``sktime`` values contributions of any kind - not just code.
Below are examples of what ``sktime`` counts as contributions, either to code or community.

The arbitration committee will have the final say on criteria satisfaction if any dispute were to arise, bound by precedent.
A record of all such decisions must be publicly kept.

We count as small contributions (code) any of:

* fixing typos in documentation or docstrings. At most 3 of these count in a given period,
  and at most 1 trivial typo fix counts.
* reviewing a PR that does not require a STEP, and not dropping the review (max 2 weeks latency)
* reproducing a bug reported by a user, and reporting on reproduction

We count as small contributions (community) any of:

* answering a user question in one of the help/contributor channels (e.g., discord helpdesk) until user confirmation of answer
* participating in 3 mentoring meetings as co-mentor, in one of the ``sktime`` mentoring or internship programmes
* writing minutes in one of the ``sktime`` committee meetings
* as committee member, attending meetings of the respective committee and being minuted as present
* filling out and submitting the user registration form

We count as medium contributions (code) any of:

* at least 5 small code contributions
* successfully fixing a bug in an estimator, framework or utility code
* successfully diagnosing a bug reported by a user, or contributing substantially to identifying the cause.
  Reports already including correct (or almost correct) diagnoses count towards the reporters' tally.
* getting a code PR merged (bugfix, enhancement, etc)
* reviewing a STEP or a PR that implements a STEP
* taking on the release manager role for at least 3 sequential releases

We count as medium contributions (community) any of:

* at least 5 small community contributions
* taking on mentorship for a community member for at least 6 meetings, in one of the ``sktime`` mentoring or internship programmes
* organizing a presentation or workshop, involving and mentoring new contributors to present (just giving a presentation does not count)
* donating at least 0.1% of one's country of residence's median disposable yearly household income (w.r.t. any reference value in the period) to an ``sktime`` charitable account

We count as substantial contributions (community) any of:

* lead organizing a major community event, e.g., developer days
* running one of the ``sktime`` mentoring or internship programmes for one full period (e.g., summer)
* organizing a series of workstream or roadmap meetings that lead to successful STEP and PR
* acquiring funding in the order of 1 year of maintainer position, under strategic control of the ``sktime`` community
* leading on a relevant workstream of administrative proceedings, e.g., drafting a contract, giving legal advice
* carrying out one of the management team roles for at least 6 months according to expectation and specification [marrov: "management team role" is not clearly defined afaik - is it worth to clarify?]

We count as substantial contributions any of:

* more than 7 medium contributions in the period of any type. The overall contribution type(s) is/are determined by whichever type(s) reach(es) a count of 4 or more.


Notes:

* community contributions only count if they involve a majority of community members not from one's research group or direct network (by company affiliation or academic family tree)
* Code or community contributions related exclusively to concrete estimators (or objects) owned by oneself do not count towards eligibility. Such contributions are an expected part of the algorithm maintainer role.
* PR and repository changes pertaining to ``sktime`` governance do not count towards code contributions.
